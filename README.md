# 🏛️ DiGip – Digitale Gipsabgusssammlung (Digital plaster cast collection of archaeology at the Philipps University of Marburg) 

This website presents **3D models** of plaster casts from the archaeology collection at Philipps-Universität Marburg. The models were created as part of the course *"Visualizations in the Field of Cultural Heritage"*, aiming to make these currently inaccessible physical casts digitally available.  

⚠️ *Note:* The 3D models may take some time to load depending on your internet connection.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project was developed using **HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and Three.js**. The **3D models** were created for **training purposes** in photogrammetry, following a process of taking multiple photographs and processing them with Agisoft to generate digital representations. The models were further refined using **Blender**.  

Currently included **3D models** (original creation dates):  
- **Caracalla Farnese (~3rd century AD)**   
- **Dresden Maenad (~330 BC)** 
- **Püsterich (1st half of the 12th century)** 
- **Bust of Friedrich Gilly (1801)** (is in progress and has not yet been added)  

Each model includes **creator attributions**, which can be found next to the respective 3D representation.
